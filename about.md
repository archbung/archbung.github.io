## Hi, I'm archbung ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend engineer passionate about functional programming and type theory. 
I've been working as a mid-level backend engineer since August 2023 at Fazz, a large Indonesian fintech startup focused on financial inclusivity.

### What I Do

While my day job involves Ruby on Rails, my heart belongs to the functional programming paradigm. 
I have a strong background in Haskell and I'm always exploring new functional languages like OCaml and Elixir. 
I enjoy tackling infrastructure and DevOps challenges, from rewriting deployment manifests to managing AWS database migrations.

### What I Write About

On this blog, you'll find posts about:

- **Functional Programming**: Deep dives into FP concepts, from basic principles to advanced type theory
- **Real-world Applications**: How to apply functional programming ideas in production environments
- **Software Engineering**: Thoughts on architecture, best practices, and career development
- **Technical Explorations**: My journey learning new languages and paradigms

### My Philosophy

I believe in the power of strong type systems and pure functions to create more reliable, maintainable software. 
While pragmatism often wins in production, I think there's immense value in understanding the theoretical foundations of what we do.

### Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I'm an Olympic weightlifting enthusiast with almost 2 years of training under my belt. 
I'm also a single dad to a wonderful 10-year-old daughter who shares my interest in technology (she loves Scratch!) and bouldering.
